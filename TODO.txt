Style Tip:
The name of a method's receiver should be a reflection of its identity; often a
one or two letter abbreviation of its type suffices (such as "c" or "cl" for
"Client"). Don't use generic names such as "me", "this" or "self", identifiers
typical of object-oriented languages that place more emphasis on methods as
opposed to functions. The name need not be as descriptive as a that of a method
argument, as its role is obvious and serves no documentary purpose. It can be
very short as it will appear on almost every line of every method of the type;
familiarity admits brevity. Be consistent, too: if you call the receiver "c" in
one method, don't call it "cl" in another.
